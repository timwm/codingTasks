# codingTasks
Just an overview of my CoGrammer/Hyperiondev boot camp tasks and how I approached each of the tasks.

## Checkout some examples
 - [T02 - Getting Started with Your Bootcamp](T02%20-%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Your%20Bootcamp)
 - [T08 - File IO Operations](T08%20-%20File%20IO%20Operations)
 - [T09 - OOP - Classes](T09%20-%20OOP%20-%20Classes)

## Installation and Setup
All you need to get rolling with everything here is a standard python environment, and a shell script interpreter.
As per now no external libraries are used.

## Usage
Execute the files as you normallay would execute python/shell scripts; for any deviation to this the will be an
accompaning detailed description in the corresponding programs.
